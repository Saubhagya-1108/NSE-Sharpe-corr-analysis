# NSE-Sharpe-corr-analysis
I have constructed a quantitative portfolio engine that selects top NSE stocks based on three strict criteria: Risk &lt;25%, Sharpe >1 and Avg Correlation &lt;0.40. By filtering assets over a 3-year training period, the strategy delivered an 18.23% CAGR in a 2-year backtest. The tool uses Seaborn and Matplotlib to visualize diversification and growth.
